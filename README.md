freemlib for Neo-Geo
====================
The freemlib for Neo-Geo is a set of functions and tools for those who want to
develop for the system in assembly language. The functions could also be adapted
into use with C libraries, but I do not plan on doing so myself until the library
is better developed.

Documentation lives in the "doc" directory.
Examples of using freemlib are found in the "examples" directory.
The actual code is found in the "src" directory.
Various tools can be found in the "tools" directory.

You should read doc/usage.txt for how to setup a project with the freemlib.
