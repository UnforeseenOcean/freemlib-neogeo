freemlib for Neo-Geo
====================
The freemlib for Neo-Geo is a set of functions and tools for those who want to
develop for the system in assembly language. The functions could also be adapted
into a library for use with C, but I do not plan on doing so myself until the
library is better developed.

You should read `doc/usage.txt` for how to setup a project with the freemlib.

License
-------
I have not yet decided on an overall license for the library, but I would like
it to be a permissive one, as well as allow for the ability for others to
contribute back. Tools may be licensed differently from the main library.
