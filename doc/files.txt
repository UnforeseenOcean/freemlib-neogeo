[examples\]
This directory contains a number of examples that use the freemlib.
Examples.txt gives a quick overview of each example, while the readme.txt in
each example's directory gives a longer description.

The examples rely on being set up as they are in order to build correctly.
(e.g. a path of "..\..\src\" from an example will go to the main src directory.)

================================================================================
[src\]
This directory contains the actual code and includes that make up the freemlib.
Trying to document it here would be pointless, as it will change often.
