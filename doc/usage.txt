Using freemlib for Neo-Geo
==========================
... some shit about how some files should be edited and others shouldn't.

The best examples of generally using the freemlib for Neo-Geo are in the
examples directory. However, that doesn't cover what you should do to set up
your environment so you can actually use the freemlib in the first place.

Files to Copy (or Symlink) and Leave Alone
------------------------------------------

Files to Copy and Change

* header_68k.inc			68000 Vectors and such at $0.
* header_cart.inc			Neo-Geo program header at $100.
