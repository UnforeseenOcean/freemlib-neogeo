what the hell do I actually need the freemlib to do?
====================================================
I've started the process of moving this discussion to the functionality folder.

[Overall]
There's two ways of doing things on the Neo-Geo:
* the easy way (BIOS calls)
* the hard way (handling the hardware registers yourself)

Let's assume we're taking the easy way for now.

Things I haven't fully considered:
* P ROM bankswitching

* Timer interrupt/IRQ2
  Values are set with LSPC_TIMERHIGH and LSPC_TIMERLOW.
  LSPC_MODE sets the timer operation:

  76543210
  ||||xxxx- (unrelated)
  |||+----- Enable timer interrupt
  ||+------ Load counter on write to LSPC_TIMERLOW (set either bit 6 or 7 as well)
  |+------- Load counter at beginning of HBlank of first VBlank
  +-------- Load counter when it becomes 0

* SNK's note 5 on page 13:
"The following initialization is also necessary after the CPU is reset.
	[1] Write the transparency character (e.g. 0020H) into the VRAM
		address 0 to 3FH.
	[2] Write 0000H into VRAM address 8200H."
Essentially, clear SCB1 and SCB? for Sprite 0.

* Required AES/MVS functionality (I have stubs for some things)
Not sure what is 100% required... Has to do with responding to request codes?

* anything for the CD systems (that comes later)
 * additional BIOS calls
 * DRAM uploading and stuff

[Input]
From the "Known Issues" page on the UNIVERSE BIOS homepage

"MVS only issues
There are problems in console mode with some games when trying to use the coin
switches as select buttons (pressing a coin switch won't pause a game).
This is due to games accessing the ports directly and not via the BIOS."

Games affected:
* The Super Spy					1990 SNK
* Sengoku						1991 SNK
* Andro Dunos					1992 Visco
* 3 Count Bout					1993 SNK
* Sengoku 2						1993 SNK
* Spinmaster					1993 Data East
* Art of Fighting 2				1994 SNK
* Voltage Fighter Gowcaizer		1995 Technos
* Art of Fighting 3				1996 SNK
* Super Dodge Ball				1996 Technos
* Tecmo World Soccer '96		1996 Tecmo
* Magical Drop 3				1997 Data East
* Money Puzzle/Idol Exchanger	1997 Face
* The Last Blade				1997 SNK
* Metal Slug 2, X, 3-5			1998-2003 SNK, Mega(/Noise Factory?)
* The Last Blade 2				1998 SNK
* Ganryu						1999 Visco
* Strikers 1945 Plus			1999 Psikyo
* Sengoku 3						2001 Noise Factory
* Rage of the Dragons			2002 Evoga/Noise Factory
* Matrimelee					2003 Noise Factory

Interesting patterns of note:
* It looks pretty consistent, only 2000 and 2004-2005 aren't represented.
* SNK's usage was on and off (preference of different teams? Sengoku and Last Blade teams for sure.)
* Metal Slug 1 (under Nazca) didn't do it, but every other Metal Slug (under SNK) does...
* Visco's first and second to last Neo games were the only ones to do this...
* 2/3rds of Technos games do it. (Double Dragon doesn't?)
* Noise Factory is at least consistent about it. They might have inherited it from the Sengoku team?
