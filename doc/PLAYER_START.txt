The PLAYER_START subroutine and You
===================================
The PLAYER_START subroutine is called by the BIOS if one of the start buttons
are pressed while the corresponding player has enough credits or when the time
runs out while the game's title is being displayed.

The player who pressed Start is noted in the BIOS_START_FLAG (10FDD2H, B):
76543210
||||||||
xxxx|||+- Player 1
xxxx||+-- Player 2
xxxx|+--- Player 3
xxxx+---- Player 4

This subroutine needs to leave these bits to "1" if the game can be started,
or clear them if not. When the game is started, it has to set to "1" the
corresponding bytes for each player:

	10FDB6.b for P1 (BIOS_PLAYER1_MODE)
	10FDB7.b for P2 (BIOS_PLAYER2_MODE)
	10FDB8.b for P3 (BIOS_PLAYER3_MODE)
	10FDB9.b for P4 (BIOS_PLAYER4_MODE)

After returning, the BIOS deducts credits according to BIOS_START_FLAG.

SNK docs:
A call is made when the system instructs the game to begin. (When starting the
game from its own judgment, use the system subroutines CREDIT_CHECK and
CREDIT_DOWN, described later.) With the START_FLAG, basically only the bit
representing the player whose start button has been pressed becomes 1. For
during the MVS demo (the USER_MODE at "1"), the following shows how it works:"

COUNTRY_CODE		START_FLAG Lower 4 Bits
(10FD83H,B)			P1 Start	P2 Start
-------------------------------------------
0=Japan				0001		0011
1=U.S.A.			0001		0010
2=Europe			0001		0011

"This means: On pressing the P2 START key, Japanese and European
specifications allow the two players to start the game simultaneously, while
the U.S. specifications allow only player 2 to start the game. Therefore, for
such games as sports  games, where participation in the middle of a game is not
possible, the U.S. specifications require preselection of the two-player game
(refer  to  the sample program for these specifications). When the game is in
progress, an extension of play time or the addition of lives is available at
the player's option, and participation from the middle of play should be
available. If these options are not possible, or if it is a game like Mah-Jong,
which allows only one player to play, return after changing the applicable bit
to "0."
If any of the START FLAG bits is returned with 1, the system deducts credit.
Therefore, be sure to perform the start processing, etc. Furthermore, be sure to
keep the USER MODE at 2, or the game may be switched to another game."
