Notes on Using hoot for Neo-Geo Sound
=====================================

When listening to Neo-Geo music in hoot, "Driver Work" is actually the YM2610
registers. The first 256 bytes are the writes to ports 4/5, and the second 256
bytes are the writes to ports 6/7. If you were expecting the engine internals to
be exposed (like I was), you'll be sorely disappointed.

Due to the author of hoot being paranoid/angry/something about people using
illegal ROMs, arcade playback is capped to around a minute or so and requires a
registration key to get around. This key expires every few months and thus needs
to be re-registered.
