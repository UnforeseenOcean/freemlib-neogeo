Control Channel
================================================================================
The Control Channel is a NeoTracker-specific invention that handles song-wide
commands. In other trackers, these commands would be handled as effects in the
various channels. For some reason, I thought it would be a good idea to split
out song-wide commands into their own channel, so here we are.

Control Channel Commands are similar to Effects in that they're two bytes long.

b1 b2		Command Name							Origin/Equivalent Effect
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
00 00		No Command/nop
01 xx		Tempo 1 (0x00-0xFF = 0-255)				(NeoTracker)
02 xx		Tempo 2 (0x00-0xFF = 256-511)			(NeoTracker)
03 xx		Song Speed (0x00-0x1F)					ProTracker Fxx
04 xx		Set Timer A value LSB					(NeoTracker)
05 xx		Set Timer A value MSB (0-3 only)		(NeoTracker)
06 xx		Set Timer B value						(NeoTracker)
07 xx		SSG /Enable flags (xxNNNCBA)			(NeoTracker)
08 xx		SSG Volume Envelope Period LSB			(NeoTracker)
09 xx		SSG Volume Envelope Period MSB			(NeoTracker)
0A xx		SSG Volume Envelope Shape				(NeoTracker)
0B xx		Position Jump							ProTracker Bxx
0C xx		Stop Song								FamiTracker/DefleMask Cxx
0D xx		Pattern Break							ProTracker Dxx
0E xx		Pattern Delay							ProTracker EEx
0F xx		ADPCM-A Master Volume (6 bits; 0-63)	(NeoTracker)
10 xx		ADPCM-A Key On/Off (multiple channels)	(NeoTracker)
11 xx		Global Volume (all channels; scaled)	(NeoTracker)
12 xx		Global Volume Slide (all ch.; scaled)	(NeoTracker)

(Notes)
Though the SSG Volume Envelope commands change all channels, perhaps they could
be regular effects (in the $71-$77 range, currently).

Do we want to allow setting the Timer A/B values directly?
