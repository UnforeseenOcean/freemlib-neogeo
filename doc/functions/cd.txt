freemlib for Neo-Geo - CD System functionality
==============================================
This is currently a catch-all and may be split out later.
It will still be separate from the cart system stuff, though.

BIOS calls that go to RTS:
 * SYSTEM_INT2 (CD BIOS has a different call for this)
 * READ_CALENDAR
 * SETUP_CALENDAR
 * HOW_TO_PLAY
 * Calculate checksum

New BIOS calls:
$C004DA				HBlank handler (new SYSTEM_INT2)
$C004E0-$C004F2		"$FF0000 range register operations and RTEs" (needs more research)
$C00546				BIOSF_UPLOAD		(Upload data to DRAM)
$C00522				BIOSF_LOADFILE		(Load file from CD, with animation)
$C0055E				BIOSF_CDPLAYER		(Reset to CD Player)
$C00564				BIOSF_LOADFILEX?	(Load file from CD, no animation)
$C0056A				BIOSF_CDDACMD		(Issue CDDA command)
$C00570				BIOSF_VIDEOEN		(Enable/Disable video layers)

DRAM layout:
* 68K Program		2MB
* Sprite Tiles		4MB
* ADPCM Data		1MB

Fix tiles are in 128KB of PSRAM. The Z80 code is in a 64KB RAM block.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Custom File Loading
Perhaps there's a way around the BIOS file loading functions...

* Custom Load Screens
Easier way to deal with custom loading screens or something

* DRAM Uploading
Both partial and full would be nice I guess

* Various other features
There's still a lot of things I don't know about, as well as emu authors, since
I can't find any official documentation on the PUPPET microcode.
