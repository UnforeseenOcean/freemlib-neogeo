freemlib for Neo-Geo - Collision functionality
==============================================
Yeah this is going to be a jerk too.

There are two types of collision boxes, typically named for the colors used to display them:
1) Blue - Collision hitbox
2) Red  - Attack hitbox
there are probably better names but i don't know them offhand sorry

(Defining collision data)
Collision data is tied to animation frames.

$00			Number of Boxes (byte)
.....		Collision Box Data

(Collision Box Data)
$00			Collision Type (word; 0=normal, 1=attack)
$02			Box X1 (word; start)
$04			Box Y1 (word; start)
$06			Box X2 (word; end)
$08			Box Y2 (word; end)
