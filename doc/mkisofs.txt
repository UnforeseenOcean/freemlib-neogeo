The mkisofs tool is used to create ISO images.
https://wiki.neogeodev.org/index.php?title=ISO_generation

The example from the wiki:
mkisofs -iso-level 1 -o neogeocd.iso -pad -N -V "NGCDTEST" P1.PRG M1.Z80 SPR.SPR S1.FIX V1.PCM IPL.TXT ABS.TXT BIB.TXT CPY.TXT

The setup I prefer is something like this:
mkisofs -iso-level 1 -o neogeocd.iso -pad -N -V "NGCDTEST" --path-list pathlist.txt

where pathlist.txt is a file containing a list of directories and filenames to be
added to the filesystem. This way, you don't have to type a bunch of files on the
command line.

In addition, I have provided an example .mkisofsrc file that can be used/edited.

Another option that might be useful is -sort sortfile.txt
in which sortfile.txt includes pairs of filenames and sorted offset weights.
Files are sorted with the highest weights first and the lowest weights last.
Weight values are between -2147483647 and 2147483647.

This means you probably want to put any dummy file as -2147483647
