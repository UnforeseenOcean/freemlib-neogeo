NeoFixFormat (Version 1.0)
A YY-CHR.NET Plugin for Neo-Geo Fix Format Tiles
by AJ/freem (http://www.ajworld.net/ and http://freem.co/)
================================================================================
[Information]
This plugin allows YY-CHR.NET to natively edit Neo-Geo Fix format tiles for
cart and CD systems.

Suffer from decode8/recode8's palette index issues no longer!

Source code is included, along with a project for Visual Studio 2010 (Express).
The DLL targets .NET v2.0 (which I'm assuming all YY-CHR.NET plugins must do; the
plugin wouldn't load otherwise - take note if you're going to develop a plugin
for YY-CHR.NET).

If compiling from source, you'll need to change the reference of CharactorLib.dll
to point to your own copy. (Sorry, I'm lazy and didn't include it. It comes with
YY-CHR.NET, though.)

[Notes]
On some late-era games, the fix tiles are part of the C ROMs, which are
encrypted. This plugin does not handle any encryption, so you're on your own.
(a.k.a. Decrypt the tiles before you get here.)

[Thanks]
Special Thanks to the MAME team, especially the people who were involved in
writing src/mame/video/neogeo.c, with extreme thanks to those who worked on
neogeo_state::draw_fixed_layer().

If "Left and right nibbles might be swapped!" is still on the page, that
assumption is correct; it's in the MAME source and it's what I use in the plugin.
