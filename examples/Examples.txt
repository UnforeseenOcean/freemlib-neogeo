freemlib for Neo-Geo Examples
=============================
A number of example projects for the Neo-Geo freemlib are included.
The projects uses relative paths to the freemlib source files, which means you'll
want to edit those paths if you're working on them in a different place. Sorry!

possibilities of what can be done. Graphics and sound are provided for you.
