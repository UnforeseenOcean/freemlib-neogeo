freemlib for Neo-Geo Examples
=============================
A number of example projects for the Neo-Geo freemlib are included.
The projects uses relative paths to the freemlib source files, which means you'll
want to edit those paths if you're working on them in a different place. Sorry!

Aside from the freemlib files, each project is meant to be self-contained.

The examples are meant to be short, while trying to show enough possibilities of
what can be done.
